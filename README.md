# Liver-disease-prediction

Introduction
The liver, the largest organ in the human body, plays a crucial role in various essential functions such as digestion, energy storage, and detoxification. Any malfunctioning of the liver can lead to severe health complications and diseases. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to identify patients with liver disease early, thereby reducing the burden on healthcare professionals and improving patient outcomes.

# Causes of Liver Malfunction
Liver malfunction can be caused by several factors, including:

Viral infections (e.g., hepatitis)
Excessive alcohol consumption
Exposure to harmful gases
Consumption of contaminated or stale food, including pickles
Inherited diseases
Increasing Incidence of Liver Disease
The incidence of liver disease is on the rise globally, making it imperative to develop efficient and accurate methods for early detection. Early identification of liver disease can lead to timely intervention and better management of the condition.

# Role of Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) can assist in the early identification of liver disease by evaluating vital parameters such as liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and other biomarkers. This approach aims to provide a more efficient and accurate means of identifying at-risk patients, thereby aiding healthcare professionals in their diagnostic processes.

Project Overview
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains medical data related to liver functions. It includes several vital parameters and biomarkers that are essential for diagnosing liver disease. The dataset, however, is small, contains many outliers, and has a few missing values, which posed challenges during the modeling phase.

# Models Used
Based on performance metrics comparison and evaluation, the following models were identified as the best performers:

1 Gradient Boosting
2 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
3 Decision Tree
4 Random Forest
